Running Forbearance
====

1. forbearance\_server.py should be run in the same directory as forbearance\_keyfile.
1. the client contains hard-coded IP addresses for the server - it expects to find the server at 10.0.66.60:1214. To run this challenge, you can either patch the client with the new address of the server, or set up routing such that the server is available at those addresses.
